## Front-end
Our choice of framework is Remix. For it's fundamentally web-first principals and ease to mediate the split JS between client and server.

### Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

## CMS
Our choice of CMS is Sanity. For it's customizability and great developer experience.

### Development

From your terminal:

```sh
cd studio && npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
